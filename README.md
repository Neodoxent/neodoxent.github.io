<!-- Orientation precedes explanation -->

This repository hosts the public landing page for Neodoxent.

It functions as a stable point of orientation: a concise articulation of my practice in writing, integrative research, and conceptual systems design, with links to work hosted elsewhere.

The site is intentionally minimal by design.  
Changes are made sparingly, and only when the underlying structure meaningfully shifts.

This repository prioritizes clarity and longevity over iteration speed.

This repository is intentionally quiet.

<!-- Orientation precedes explanation -->

This repository hosts the public landing page for Neodoxent.

It functions as a stable point of orientation and deliberate engagement:
a concise articulation of my practice in writing, integrative research,
and conceptual systems design, followed by a structured threshold
for readers who choose to proceed further.

The site is intentionally minimal by design.  
Changes are made sparingly, and only when the underlying structure meaningfully shifts.

This repository prioritizes clarity and longevity over iteration speed.

<!-- This repository documents structure, not interpretation -->

This repository is intentionally quiet.

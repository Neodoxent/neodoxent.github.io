      <h4>Orientation Notice</h4>
      <p>
        This page functions as a threshold document.
        It is not an introduction, summary, or promotional overview.
        Its purpose is to establish the conditions under which subsequent material
        may be meaningfully engaged.
      </p>
      <p>
        What follows is concerned with structure, interpretation, and method,
        rather than instruction or persuasion.
      </p>

    This notice establishes what kind of material this is.
  </p>
    
    <!-- W2 -->
    <section class="warning scope">
      <h4>Scope and Intent</h4>
      <p>
        The material beyond this threshold explores complex phenomena involving
        meaning-making, cognition, emotional structure, symbolic representation,
        and systems-level thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is exploratory rather than doctrinal.
        It does not present fixed conclusions, prescriptive frameworks,
        or authoritative models intended for universal application.
      </p>
    </section>
    
  <p class="micro">
    This notice clarifies how claims should be understood.

    <!-- W3 -->
    <section class="warning epistemic">
      <h4>Epistemic Position</h4>
      <p>
        Claims made in this work operate at the level of articulation,
        interpretation, and conceptual modeling.
        They are not empirical findings, clinical directives,
        or statements of external fact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Valid engagement depends on the reader’s ability to distinguish
        between description, metaphor, and lived interpretation.

    <!-- W4 -->
    <section class="warning cognitive-load">
      <h4>Cognitive Load Advisory</h4>
      <p>
        Sustained attention is required.
        The material is intentionally dense and layered,
        and is not designed for rapid consumption or surface-level scanning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Readers may experience delayed comprehension,
        recursive reflection, or the need to revisit sections
        after intervals of rest or distance.
      </p>
    </section>

   <p class="micro">
     This notice concerns how meaning may behave under strain.

    <!-- W5 -->
    <section class="warning interpretive-risk">
      <h4>Interpretive Risk Notice</h4>
      <p>
        Misinterpretation is possible, particularly if the material
        is approached with expectations of linear explanation,
        immediate clarity, or instrumental utility.
      </p>
      <p>
        In such cases, ambiguity may increase rather than resolve,
        and perceived instability may reflect interpretive mismatch
        rather than properties of the material itself.

  <p class="micro">
    This notice concerns personal boundaries and responsibility.

    <!-- W6 -->
    <section class="warning ethical">
      <h4>Ethical Engagement Notice</h4>
      <p>
        This work engages with aspects of human experience that may be
        personally meaningful or psychologically resonant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Readers are encouraged to maintain appropriate boundaries,
        to disengage if distress arises,
        and to avoid treating the material as diagnostic, therapeutic,
        or directive in nature.

    <!-- W7 -->
    <section class="warning critical authorial">
      <h4>Authorial Responsibility</h4>
      <p>
        Reading alone is insufficient.
        Engagement with this material carries interpretive responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are expected to justify, extend, or refuse this warning explicitly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reader is responsible for how meaning is constructed,
        extended, challenged, or refused.
        No authority is delegated by proximity to the work itself.
      </p>
    </section>

  <p class="micro">
    This notice affirms the legitimacy of disengagement.

    <!-- W8 -->
    <section class="warning exit-right">
      <h4>Right of Refusal</h4>
      <p>
        You may stop here.
        Choosing not to proceed is a complete and valid outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        No understanding, insight, or loss is incurred by disengagement.
        The threshold exists to preserve clarity, not to compel entry.

    <!-- W9 -->
    <section class="warning non-instrumental">
      <h4>Non-Instrumentality Notice</h4>
      <p>
        This material is not optimized for extraction, optimization,
        or immediate application.
      </p>
      <p>
        Attempts to treat it as a technique, framework,
        or productivity instrument may result in frustration
        or conceptual flattening.
      </p>
    </section>

   <p class="micro">
     This notice concerns when understanding may occur.
   </p>

    <!-- W10 -->
    <section class="warning temporal">
      <h4>Temporal Expectation Advisory</h4>
      <p>
        Understanding may not arise during initial reading.
        Insight, if it occurs, may emerge later,
        outside the moment of engagement.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a property of complex conceptual material,
        not a measure of reader aptitude.

  <p class="micro">
    This notice concerns how the material holds together.

    <!-- W11 -->
    <section class="warning context">
      <h4>Context Integrity Warning</h4>
      <p>
        Isolated excerpts may misrepresent intent,
        tone, or structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meaning here is relational.
        Removing material from its surrounding context
        may distort both content and effect.
      </p>
    </section>

   <p class="micro">
     This notice concerns what the reader brings with them.

    <!-- W12 -->
    <section class="warning positional">
      <h4>Reader Position Disclosure</h4>
      <p>
        Interpretation is shaped by the reader’s background,
        expectations, and current state.
      </p>
      <p>
        Disagreement, resonance, or confusion
        may reveal as much about position
        as about the material itself.
